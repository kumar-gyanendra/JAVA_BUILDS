# ♨️ JAVA_BUILDS

A collection of Java programs, exercises, experiments, and daily builds created to improve coding skills, explore new concepts, and develop practical tools.

## 📘 Overview

**JAVA_BUILDS** is a structured collection of Java solutions to coding problems from various competitive programming and interview preparation platforms. This repository serves as a personal practice archive where I solve, store, and review problems to improve my Java programming skills, strengthen my logic, and prepare for technical assessments.

The goals of this repository are to:

- Build a strong foundation in Java programming and problem-solving
- Practice algorithms and data structures through real coding challenges
- Organize solutions by platform for easy reference
- Maintain a record of my learning journey
- Provide clean, readable, and well-structured Java code
  
This repository grows gradually as I solve new problems from platforms such as **LeetCode**, **HackerRank**, **CodeChef**, **Codeforces**, and more.
